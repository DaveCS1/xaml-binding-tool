# XAML Binding Debug Output
Provides a tool window that shows XAML binding errors while debugging in Visual Studio 2019. The tool window makes it much easier to detect and understand the binding errors in your XAML that would normally be hidden in the output window.

This is currently in the prototyping phase I figure out what features are most useful to users. Feedback is appreciated!
